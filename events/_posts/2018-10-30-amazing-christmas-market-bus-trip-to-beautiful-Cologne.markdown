Ho ho ho!!

Dear fellow PhD students,

As you all must be aware, Christmas is coming and hence it is a good time for shopping and some warm Glühwein. Hence to mark the beginning of the end of the year 2018, we are organizing a day/evening trip to the Christmas market in Cologne on **Saturday the 8th of December** for you (and your partner).

![Cologne](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Cologne_montage.png)

For those who haven’t been to Cologne, it is a metropolitan German city located about 2 hours from Eindhoven by bus. Cologne is a beautiful city and I personally recommend everyone to visit the place once, especially during the Christmas market. For more information about the city check out the [the following link][cologne-info-link].

I hope you all join for the trip.

Kind regards,

Hora Est
