Since we have all been working hard, it is time to cut a bit of slack, loosen up and meet other PhDs. So Hora Est is hosting another informal borrel with drinks, (of course! Alcoholic and non-alcoholic) some snacks and fun games. So we would like to invite you all to come join us for a laid back evening **Friday the 26th of October**.

And as always, ***drinks are on the house***!!

Hope to see you at the borrel!
