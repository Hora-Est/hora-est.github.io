Sinterklaas is here and soon it will be vacation time. So in the spirit of celebration we are hosting a borrel on Friday the 30th of November. We would like to invite you all to come join us for a laid back evening with drinks, some games and possibly pizzas. We hope to see you all at the borrel.

Kind Regards,


Shravan
