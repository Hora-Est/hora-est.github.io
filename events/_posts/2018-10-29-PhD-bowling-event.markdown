On the **17th of november ’18** Hora Est is organizing a bowling event for PhDs. The plan is to have a fun evening with bowling and BEERS! If we have a group big enough we might also plan to turn the event into a competition event to decide the ultimate Bowling champion among us :D. The main objective of the evening is to have fun and relax a little before coming back to work the next week.

The Venue for the event is Mega Bowling Woensel.

I would like to invite everyone for the event and hope that most will join us. As always, partners are most welcome to join.  The bowling lane reservation and the first two drinks are on the house, extra food/drinks will be paid for individually.

Kind Regards,

Hora Est
