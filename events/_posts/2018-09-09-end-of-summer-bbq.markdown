From this month onwards, the students will be beginning a New Academic year and this gives another opportunity to celebrate and have some fun. Hence, we have plan on spoiling ourselves with probably the two most important components for sustaining human civilization; **Barbeque** and **Beer**. We'll be firing up the grill during the evening time on **Friday the 14th of September**. We cordially invite everyone to join us, partners are also welcome.

Kind Regards,

Hora Est

P.s. If you have just recently joined as a PhD candidate, would also kindly request you to register yourself as a Hora-Est member by sending us a mail at horaest@tue.nl , this will make future communications much more simpler. Thank You.
